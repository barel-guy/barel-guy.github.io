This project explores the potential of transforming graph-structured data into a textual format for processing by traditional Text-based Transformer models. Drawing inspiration from the work by (Dwivedi & Bresson 2021), we diverge from their approach of reconfiguring the transformer architecture to suit graph data, and instead, steer towards manipulating graph data for effective use with text-based transformers. We facilitate this transformation by transcribing the nodes and edges of the graph into a sequential textual format. The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is leveraged to traverse the graph, simultaneously extracting the labels from the nodes and edges. In doing so, we successfully transmute the non-sequential structure of a graph into a format that is well-suited for sequential processing methods. This transformed data is then fed into a standard text-based Transformer, specifically utilizing the LongFormer model. The project was evaluated on the ZINC molecule dataset with the task of graph property regression for constrained solubility. The results were promising, as Text-based Transformers demonstrated a notable ability to interpret and process this restructured data format when presented with transformed graph structures as text sequences.
